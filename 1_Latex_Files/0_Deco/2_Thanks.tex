My special thanks goes to Andrei Merle, who was 
the supervisor of this work. He showed  his 
knowledge in a modest way, supported 
me actively in getting this work completed by 
helping me solving equations, reviewing my 
work and providing beneficial tricks and tips. 
Especially, when it came to solving equations,
I really appreciated his help. 
Thank you for your time and 
effort you spend on this work Andrei Merle. \newline

Also, Professor Stefan Görtz - At
each end of our conversations, he would 
ask me to call him, if any problems or 
questions would arise - thank you for 
your support Professor Görtz.
